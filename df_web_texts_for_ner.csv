Handmade by Beadlight in the UK, the Cirrus collection was originally designed for use in private jet aircraft, and first and business class cabins. The range has proved incredibly successful in hotels, private residences and mega yachts. Built to the exacting standards demanded by the aeropsace industry, each Beadlight reading light is made by hand and wrapped in English leather with hand stitching.
- Ideal as a bedhead light, the luxurious fitting provides two brightness settings for reading.
- Can be mounted to existing walls and bed heads.
- Simple installation is required by an electrician.
- Energy Efficient. These LED lights become the perfect solution to make substantial energy savings.
- The wall lights use 1.4 watts of energy and require a 12v transformer, not included.
- Previously available only to architects and interior designers, the Beadlight collection is now available to the public exclusively through Dunlin.

Florence Knoll
Born to a baker, and orphaned at age twelve, Florence Schust grew up Saginaw, Michigan. Schust demonstrated an early interest in architecture and was enrolled at the Kingswood School for Girls, adjacent to the Cranbrook Academy of Art.
While at Kingswood, Florence befriended Eilel Saarinen, whom she would later study under at Cranbrook. Warmly embraced by the Saarinen family, Florence vacationed with them in Finland, enjoyed the company of their accomplished friends, and formed a very close relationship with Eliel’s son, Eero. The connections she made and the skills she developed while at Cranbrook were the foundations of Florence Schust’s incredible design education and pioneering career. With recommendations from Eliel Saarinen and Alvar Aalto, Florence went on to study under some of the greatest 20th century architects, including Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer in Cambridge, Massachusetts and Ludwig Mies van der Rohe at the Illinois Institute of Technology.
Portraits of Florence Knoll through the years. Images from the Knoll Archive.
In 1941 Florence moved to New York where she met Hans Knoll who was establishing his furniture company. With Florence’s design skills and Hans’ business acumen and salesmanship, the pair, who married in 1946, grew the nascent company into an international arbiter of style and design. Florence also seeded contributions with her friends Eero Saarinen, Harry Bertoia, and Mies van der Rohe.
“She had that ability, to critique [something], to tear it apart and put it back together. She was something else.”
—Bob Longwell
Florence Knoll paste-up for Cowles Publication. Image from the Knoll Archive.
In creating the revolutionary Knoll Planning Unit, Florence Knoll defined the standard for the modern corporate interiors of post-war America. Drawing on her background in architecture, she introduced modern notions of efficiency, space planning, and comprehensive design to office planning. Florence ardently maintained that she did not merely decorate space. She created it. The Planning Unit rigorously researched and surveyed each client — assessing their needs, defining patterns of use and understanding company hierarchies — before presenting a comprehensive design, informed by the principles of modernism and beautifully executed in signature Knoll style. Florence and the Planning Unit were responsible for the interiors of some of America’s largest corporations, including IBM, GM and CBS.
Cowles Publication interior, designed by Florence Knoll. Image from the Knoll Archive.
As part of her work with the Planning Unit, Florence frequently contributed furniture designs to the Knoll catalog. She humbly referred to her furniture designs as the “meat and potatoes,” filler among the standout pieces of Bertoia, Mies, and Saarinen. However, with her attention to detail, eye for proportion, and command of the modern aesthetic, many of her designs have become as revered and celebrated as those of her colleagues.
“I designed the architectural [elements] that were needed to make the room work, things like the walls, [tables] and sofas.”
—Florence Knoll
Florence Knoll-designed Coffee and Side Tables. Image from the Knoll Archive.
After the tragic death of Hans Knoll in 1955, Florence Knoll led the company as president through uncertain times. In 1960 she resigned the presidency to focus on directing design and development and, in 1965 after pioneering an industry and defining the landscape and aesthetic of the corporate office, Florence Knoll Bassett (she remarried in 1957) retired from the company. Her contributions to Knoll, and to the rise of modernism in America, are immeasurable.

Key Features - Mango Timber
The timber used in this piece is sustainably sourced Mango Wood. Each plank is individually treated in a computer controlled kiln to reduce the chance of any cracks or warping in its long future as a furniture component.
This piece has been handcrafted by one of our Vast Masters, these individual cabinet makers have been manufacturing Vast products for over a decade. Using traditional joinery techniques to maximise the timber's natural beauty is a big part of the unique look of each Vast product. We call this ""working with the grain"". After the joinery is complete it is then hand sanded and hand polished with several coats of high grade German lacquer so it will last for generations!
Country of Origin:
India
Product Care - Timber
Hardwood is a natural material which reacts to its environment and although our manufacturing process allows for normal expansion and contraction, extreme high or low humidity may cause more swelling than normal. To minimise movement and ensure longevity of your purchase we recommend taking good care of your piece as outlined below:
Dust regularly with a clean cotton cloth;
Use tablecloths, table runners and coasters to help prevent  scratches to the surface and wipe up any spills immediately;
To nourish and protect your furniture we recommend waxing with a natural beeswax every 6-12 months.
Only use natural wax
, oil or water based cleaning products. Do not use solvent based cleaning products that may contain silicone or alcohol, as this may react and permanently damage the lacquer.
Do not expose to fragrant oils, insect repellent lotion, or nail polish remover
as these are often solvent based and will damage the lacquer
Avoid placing your furniture near fireplaces, in direct sunlight or under heating/cooling vents.
Do not leave hot items or ice cold items directly on the surface of the table as water marking may occur.
Any metal work featuring on your product has been powder coated. Any damage to the surface should be contained as soon as possible to prevent rusting.

All upholstery is hand-sewn onto the frame to ensure a perfect fit.

Shipping & Returns
How long does shipping and delivery take?
In the Portland metro area, our lead time is 12 to 14 weeks. For the rest of the continental United States, lead times will include 2 to 4 additional weeks for shipping.
Due to current supply chain challenges, please note that
the lead time(s) provided at the time of sale are a representation of our understanding, in the moment, of the furniture or component part’s future availability. Lead times are subject to change and are influenced by many factors outside of our control. We will keep you advised of any delays that arise as the information is received.
Can I pick my furniture up?
We offer Will Call services for furniture delivered to Portland. A $125 fee applies, and furniture that is picked up by you (or your representative) from our delivery service warehouse must be inspected at the warehouse and signed off on as ""in good condition"" before it will be released to you. Perch cannot accept responsibility for any damage that occurs once the furniture is released.
What if my furniture doesn't fit?
The customer is responsible for verifying building access and all entry measurements (doorways, stairwells, elevators, etc.). Additional delivery charges may be assessed for walkups or extra time spent if the furniture does not fit via normal means. Furniture that does not fit will be refunded in store credit only and original shipping fees will not be credited. Additional shipping and delivery charges will apply to orders that use store credit.

Materials and finishes
Black American walnut
Black walnut is a hardwood with a rich and straight-grained timber, it can display many unique characteristics, such as knots and variations in depth of tone. The walnut we source is native to North America. We use a protective lacquer finish which enables the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage.
European oak
European oak is a temperate white oak hardwood native to Europe. It presents a golden to light brown hue with a minimal grain pattern. We use a protective white oil finish to allow the timber to age gracefully without heavy discolouration and withstand daily spillage.
Dark brown house leather
Our house leather is a dark brown aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time.
Care guide
Oiled wood
An oiled finish is a durable natural looking finish that can be revitalised (and if necessary, more easily repaired). Oiled finishes require some low level maintenance to keep the wood protected and looking its best.
Day to day cleaning:
• Wipe clean with a damp non-abrasive cloth, then using a dry cloth remove any excess moisture.
• Wipe up wine, oil and any liquids that might stain as quickly as possible.
• To ensure the finish remains as resilient as possible to staining we recommend Osmo Wash & Care (8016) as it contains soaps and oils to both nourish and prevent the wood from drying out.
6 monthly replenishment / more stubborn stains:
• As the table is used it can dry out as the oil can thin with wear and washing with water alone. If the table looks dry or you have a more stubborn stain we recommend using a revitalising Osmo Liquid Wax Cleaner (white 3087) for oak pieces and (clear 3029) for walnut pieces
Do not:
• Leave any water, wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible. (Oil provides a semi-permeable finish, which means some liquids can penetrate the surface if left)
• Use ANY chemical cleaning products or bleach as this will remove the protective layer of oil and it will then stain.
Lacquered wood
A lacquered finish requires very little maintenance and is durable and resistant to spills.
Day to day cleaning:
• Wipe clean with a damp cloth then buff off with a clean, dry cloth.
Do not:
• Leave any wine, oil or liquids that might stain – wipe up as quickly as possible.
• Use any abrasive cleaning products or bleach as this could damage the protective layer of lacquer.
House leather
Our house leather is a pure aniline leather. As such, it may reveal natural markings such as scarring, growth marks and variation in tone and colour. These markings are a part of the beauty of the leather which has been selected for its natural materiality, high quality and comfort. As a natural material it will age according to its environment, creating a beautiful patina over time. We recommend you avoid placing furniture in direct sunlight or next to strong heat sources as this can cause aniline leather to discolour or dry out prematurely.
Day to day cleaning:
• As an untreated material, the leather is naturally absorbent. If cleaning is essential for small marks, carefully dab with a clean, lint-free cloth, and vacuum gently using the small brush attachment. For more pronounced marks, please refer to a professional leather cleaner.
Do not:
• Use any abrasive or chemical cleaning products or bleach, as this will damage the leather.

DURAWOOD® Poly Porch Swing
by Pawleys Island
Eco-Friendly DURAWOOD®:
DURAWOOD® is a 3/4""-1"" lumber, compared to 1/2"" thick offered by our competitors, that's made from densely compressed recycled industrial waste. It contains no waste-wood fiber so it won't absorb any water and won't rot, splinter or crack. DURAWOOD® is fade resistant and will never require paint, stain or any kind of sealant.
Stainless Steel Hardware:
High quality 316 marine-grade stainless steel hardware is used on our outdoor furniture, compared to 304 marine-grade used by our competitors, for superior rust resistance. All hardware is painted to match the color of the furniture and strategically place to conceal each bolt.
Mortise and Tenon Joints:
We use this ancient form of carpentry, where board meets board, to allow our furniture to fit together and help make it sturdier; rather than just being held together with nuts and bolts.

Product Type:
Platform Bed
Vendor:
TY Fine Furniture
Description
The Enso Platform Bed invites you to peaceful slumber with its gentle curves that are reminiscent of the
Myojin torii
, the Japanese gates guarding Shinto shrines. A higher headboard with the slightest incline offers comfort for reading and watching TV. Crafted with traditional joinery from solid wood, this bed frame offers a sturdy and lasting foundation for rest. Enjoy stable support as you sleep every night knowing your bed frame can serve you for years.
Bed Specifications
Sizes
All Enso Beds Have a 12"" Tall Platform and a 44"" tall headboard with 10.25"" clearance under the bed. This bed frame is designed to accommodate mattresses 10-14” thick. If your mattress is different, we can customize a frame to fit your needs at no added cost.

Wood Finish Options
Wood Options
We never stain our wood. It is all 100% natural solid wood in cherry, walnut, oak, and maple. Each wood option is the actual wood species your item will be built using. This gives you a prettier wood grain and a better quality piece of furniture.
Finish
Every piece is meticulously and sumptuously finished with our signature finishes formulated from non-toxic, all-natural ingredients with zero VOC emissions. This makes our pieces a great option for those looking for organic furniture.
Customization
We started our business as a custom furniture shop in Columbus, Ohio, we understand the value, importance and cost of full custom made furniture.
We now offer a variety of customization options for all our standard items often at a very nominal cost. Enjoy custom furniture without the hassles of fully designing an item and at a fraction of the cost.

IMPORTANT - Lead Times & Pre-Orders
Lead Times May Apply - Stock Availability:
As we are an online only store all of our furniture items are delivered directly from our amazing brand partners. We work very closely with them to understand stock availability, but we also don’t like to disappoint our customers if it is out of stock or if there is a lead time as stock levels change frequently.
Therefore if an item has a ""lead times may apply' message this means they may be in stock or have a lead time of 4 - 12 weeks, it just means we need to double check stock availability as they are super popular.
Feel free however to place an order now as w
e also guarantee a full refund (within the week of purchase), if we contact you to advise the item is out of stock and/or lead times are longer than expected.
Pre-Orders:
We do however highly recommend placing a pre-order as items can sell out prior to shipments arriving, and this will ensure you receive your piece in the next shipment.  If you would like
estimated lead times, shipping quotes or any other information please try the instant chat or click on the Get In Touch button and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
We can arrange a 50% deposit for all pre-order items, with balance due prior to delivery.
Lead Times:
Cranmore Home & Co quote an approximate lead time for the receipt of any orders based on information provided by their partner suppliers at time of purchase. Circumstances beyond our control, may cause disruptions and lead to a delay in your order being delivered on quoted lead times once an order is placed.  We will keep you as up to date as possible on any changes to estimated lead times.
Shipping & Delivery Fees
Delivery:
What we can promise is that we will ship all in-stock products from our Perth warehouse within 3 business days and in the case of bespoke or out-of-stock products, customers will be emailed as soon as possible with an estimated shipping date.  As we are an online business and many of our larger items are delivered directly from our suppliers, in this case we endeavour to ensure that our suppliers dispatch in-stock items within 5-10 business days. Delivery all depends on where it is coming from and where you live. We generally allow
7-14 days
most metro areas and for many country locations, WA, NT & Tasmania please allow
2-3 weeks
.
NOTE:
For pre-orders from suppliers with stock coming from international manufacturers please keep in mind, the current worldwide increase in demand and restrictions for international ocean freight container exports.  This is affecting supply chains extensively and sometimes lead time extensions are out of our control.
Shipping:
All items have a flat fee based on weight, dimensions and delivery location. This cost ranges from $9.95 - $250 for metro areas throughout Australia and this will be applied at checkout if required. For regional areas throughout Australia or for some super heavy/bulky/fragile items you may incur an additional fee, this will be advised after checkout, prior to dispatch if required. If you would like a quote tailored for your order prior to check out please
contact us
.
Some of our items are
available for collection
from our Perth warehouse and will have this information on the product page if available.
Orders over $2500 are eligible for free shipping to metro cities (exc TAS & NT).
For all orders over $2500 that fall within regional postcodes they will incur an additional delivery charge invoiced after order. Please contact us for a quote prior to order if you would like this confirmed.
PLEASE NOTE:
Delivery is to your post box or front door only.  If you require white glove service of delivery, placement of item and removal of packaging please contact us to arrange.  Additional costs will be incurred.

Mattresses by HipVan
Designed by HipVan for a firm and comfortable sleep, the SLEEP Mattress is constructed with a pocket spring base and topped with an extra thick layer of high density foam that supports your body while you sleep. Wrapped in cooling fabric, this mattress will keep you comfortable and cool all night. Manufactured and designed for the perfect balance of support and comfort, sleep well tonight with the Sleep mattress.
Assembly inclusive
Firmness: Medium-firm, 9/10 with 10 being the firmest
Adaptive Cooling Knitted Fabric Cover *
• Soft, ultra-breathable and cooling material encases the top and bottom of the mattress.
• Anti-fungal and anti-bacterial treatment enhances durability and provides easy maintenance.
Ergonomic 5-zone Individual Pocket Spring
• Our ergonomic 5-zone pocket spring responds individually to your major pressure areas.
• Extra thick and strong coil springs are individually pocketed to prevent movement transfer and minimise disturbance.
• Engineered to support your spine’s natural alignment, allowing you to relax into a restorative sleep and wake feeling pain-free and refreshed.
Cool Gel Infused Foam *
• The cool gel infused foam provides extra comfort and help to reduce heat build-up, creating a refreshing sleep environment.
Transitional Foam
• A layer of high-density foam enhances the comfort
• Responsiveness and support of all the other layers
• Provides additional structure and durability for a mattress that lasts
Foam Encasement
• Sturdy foam encasement on all sides helps the springs stay firmly in place and prevents the sides of the mattress from sagging.
• Euro Top design
• 100 Nights Risk-Free Trial
• Allow the mattress 24-72 hours to fully inflate by keeping it uncovered in a well-ventilated room to help air reach the foam layers.
Note: Product may vary slightly from images due to photoshoot lighting conditions and screen settings, and/or where applicable, variation of natural materials (e.g. wood, marble and leather grains)

Our Happy Customers
We have been customers for over 13 years.  Charlie has always gone above and beyond with great customer service!  We recommend them to all our friends.  Just recently we needed an adjustable bed after my mom’s injury and we needed ASAP to be able to bring her mom from the hospital.  As always Charlie made it happen!  Great store and great employees!!!!
Caryl H.
I have shopped at Wayne’s Furniture for years and always had a Great experience. Charlie is the greatest salesman and very honest about his knowledge in furniture. When something goes wrong with the furniture like the switches on the couch or chair he always sends Mike who is very Knowledgeable and fixes it instead of buying new furniture.  Charlie is trustworthy and makes sure his customers are happy with the service provided. GREAT job Charlie keep up the good work!!!!
Tammy B.
I found there is a great reason why Wayne's Fine Furniture has been around for so long - it's their great knowledge of the furniture industry, ability to navigate the current logistical challenges, and awesome customer service that puts Wayne's above its competitors.  Charlie was a true partner through the process, helping to troubleshoot when my furniture was held up in transit.  I would definitely recommend Wayne's!!
Susanne K.
By far one of the most positive experiences you can get at a furniture store, Charlie goes above and beyond to make sure you are completely satisfied even a year after the sale was done. That’s the type of service and commitment you just see less and less of these days. Would highly recommend for your next furniture purchase! Also the prices and quality are unmatched.
Nick K.
My husband and I bought our very first home a couple months back so we decided to furnish our new home. We shopped and shopped until we came across this mom and pop store Wayne’s Furniture. We went in and furnished the master bedroom as well as my youngest sons room. Charlie is great! Super customer friendly savvy, fast delivery. I LOVE my bed and anyone who tours my home comments on my bed! My sons first time in his own room and he was too excited to start decorating! Thanks again Wayne’s Furniture- check them out. 5/5 stars for me
Shaura H.
I was first introduced to Wayne’s furniture by my brother. Who only makes recommendations if he knows the company or person is reputable. Needless to say, Charlie and his staff did not disappoint. Even, with uncontrollable delivery delays they kept us updated on every step of the way. If you want quality furniture and good service use Waynes!!!

Adding product to your cart
Elegantly sculptural, the Molloy collection of dining tables, chairs, shelving and coffee tables feature fluid detailing inspired by a rare act of nature.
The idea for the artfully rounded joinery, where two elements meet and seamlessly become one, comes from the unusual meeting of two rivers to form the Molloy River in Western Australia – a place where Adam Goodrum hand-built a holiday home with his family. The Molloy collection is available in a variety of timber finishes.
Winner of the Good Design Awards 2016.

By Adam Goodrum
A firm believer that every environment is defined by the objects within it, Adam Goodrum designs with the philosophy that an object must therefore justify its existence – through its story and detailing. For this reason, his designs celebrate process and craftsmanship, and accentuate components and joinery to create functional pieces with spirit and personality. In recent years, Goodrum’s work has been awarded a host of design accolades including the NGV Rigg Prize, Vogue x Alessi Design Prize, Indesign Luminary Award and the Idea Awards Editor’s Medal. He has also been commissioned to design pieces for several global luxury brands including Veuve Clicquot, Alessi and Cappellini.

teak
Teak
Teak is a close grained hardwood with a high natural oil content. This makes it hard wearing, highly resistant to rotting and almost impervious to the effects of sun, rain, frost or snow. These characteristics combine to make it the ideal timber for all outdoor applications. Only premium grade plantation-grown teak is used for the manufacture of Gloster furniture. The features of premium grade teak are a straight grain structure, the absence of knots, splits or cracks and an even overall colour.
INDOOR USE
Gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour. If you intend to use your furniture indoors or under cover outside (where it will not get wet), the teak will retain much of its original colour and the soft sheen of its buffed finish. Any marks, stains or damage to the buffed teak finish can be restored using the Gloster Buffed Teak Repair Kit.
OUTDOOR USE
Gloster buffed teak benefits from an enhanced surface preparation procedure, where the natural oils already contained within the teak are brought to the surface and burnished to produce a rich sheen and a consistent colour.
As with natural finish teak, left to age naturally outside, buffed teak will gradually change to a soft, silver-grey as the pigments in the surface layer of the wood begin to fade away. After the first few exposures to water, you should also expect the surface grain to rise slightly. As a part of the buffing process, the surface is wetted before final sanding to raise the grain, so there will be significantly less raised grain on buffed teak than on natural finish teak. We recommend that you allow your teak furniture to weather naturally this way and simply clean thoroughly once or twice a year with our Teak Cleaner. Buffed teak furniture may also benefit from an occasional light sanding to remove any raised grain and restore a smooth finish to the surface. Under no circumstances should a power washer be used to clean teak furniture as this will erode the surface.
Because teak is a naturally oily wood, it is not possible to paint or varnish. Any paint or varnish applied will not adhere properly to the surface and after a short while will start to peel off.
If you wish to retain the golden-brown colour of new teak we also offer a Teak Sealer. Application of Teak Sealer will not affect the strength or longevity of the furniture in any way, just its appearance. If you elect to use Teak Sealer you will be embarking on a regular maintenance programme as Teak Sealer needs to be regularly re-applied to provide continuous protection.
If you intend to store your furniture over the winter, we recommend that you do so in a water-tight garden shed or garage. However, we advise that you do not move teak furniture from the garden straight into a heated indoor room for storage, as the sharp differences in temperature and humidity may cause the wood to split.
To protect teak surfaces from staining and to help maintain the silver-grey patina on weathered teak, we recommend using our Teak Protector. Our Teak Protector creates an almost invisible shield which helps to prevent food (coffee, ketchup, red wine, olive oil, etc.) penetrating into the teak and causing unsightly stains. Teak Protector also helps protects the wood against the ingress of moisture, the adhesion of dirt and prevents mildew growth.

Lighting
A lamp is more than an aesthetic piece of design. The light you choose has a significant effect on the ambience and character of your room, and make a big difference in making it a functional and comfortable space.
Creating the perfect light in a room is far from an easy task. Combine various light sources and use wall lamps, pendants, floor and table lamps to create layered lighting and make a functional light scape that adds beauty to overall design schemes. The perfect living room lighting provides an overall warming illumination while also adding a functional light for reading and a discreet soothing light for relaxation. Invite floor and table lamps into your décor for where extra light is needed and let pendants add sculptural expressions to your living room, hallway or dining room.
Our collection of lamps range from sculptural eye-catching pendants, classic and timeless ceiling lamps, to playful wall lamps and table lamps with nostalgic expressions. We strive to create inviting and edifying lighting atmospheres that make you feel at home and at ease, wherever you are.

Description
The Jack leather and wood stool is the perfect compliment to a beautiful kitchen island or bar. It is equally suited to a relaxed modern Los Angeles home as it is to a New York City apartment.  The steel footrest is an added comfort for resting your heels.  Thoughtful detailing enhances the simple design of this Lostine collection. Each thick leather seat has its own character and variations lending to the appeal of the material. The leather will vary in color and darken with age, like a great bag or a favorite pair of boots. The frame is made of a hard maple wood and sealed to protect the wood but keep the beauty of the wood's natural color. Made in the USA.
This item is non-returnable. Excluded from shipping promotions.

Details
+ Our Harness leather ages over time, in what we call a ""living finish"". Scratches, dents, folds and marks occur naturally in the leather. We do not view these marks as defects. Please note that hue and color varies between hides. Since each side of leather is different, the shade and texture of the leather will vary with each chair. Finish samples available upon request.
+  Orders of 3 or more stools may require a freight shipment.  Please inquire with any questions regarding freight deliveries.
CARE
+ We recommend using a microfiber dust cloth to care for wood pieces. Kindly avoid additional cleaners and products.
+  Please care for your leather products with a soft cloth and leather cleaner.  Please be advised that exposure to sunlight and water will darken the leather.

FAQs
What does 'Made-to-Order' mean?
Made-to-order means that once we receive your order, it gets included in a production run of that item and when it is completed, it ships to you directly. This reduces waste (we don’t overproduce inventory or cut into materials that aren’t needed), and keeps our small, hardworking team organized. We have a limited number of people on our team and a made-to-order workflow, so we are only able to produce a certain number of items each week in order to maintain our lead times.
Can you rush my order?
We are unable to rush any made-to-order items, however from time to time we have a small stock of this lamp available on our
Ready to Ship
page.
As an designer or architect, do I qualify for a trade discount?
We offer trade services to interior designers, decorators and architects. Members of our Trade Program enjoy an exclusive discount, complimentary samples, tax exemption and more.

deliveries & returns
WE OFFER FREE UK DELIVERY ON ALL ORDERS OVER £50
We process orders Monday - Friday between 9.30am and 5pm.  Please
contact us
with any order enquiries during these hours at hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk or give us a call on
01732 490851.
DELIVERY
For items we carry in stock, you should receive your order within 3-5 working days, depending on where you are based in the UK.
Due to the bespoke nature and wide choice of our lighting and furniture items, most are not held in stock. We will specifically order these in for you as per the finish, size or colour you have selected at the point of order.  Delivery times vary by product and design partner, so please find the relevant lead time information on the product page. Once orders have been received into our warehouse we will arrange final delivery with you.
We offer a simple and competitive delivery rate:
Delivery details UK
Price
Orders up to the value of £50
£4.99
Orders over £50
Free
Please note, Highlands and Islands deliveries are not included in the UK charges above and may be charged an additional fee so please check prices with us prior to ordering.
There are rare occasions where factors out of our control can delay a delivery, so we ask for your patience in these circumstances and we promise to keep you up to date should this apply to your order.
Overseas delivery
We can deliver overseas and will need to offer a quotation. Please
contact us
for a quote, with the details of your order and its destination hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk |
01732 490851
.
Delivery Partners
We use Royal Mail, UPS or APC to deliver accessories, small furniture & lighting. Delivery is Monday to Friday, we will notify you once the item has been sent and provide tracking details where applicable.
For large furniture orders such as sofas, we use a specialist furniture home delivery team, who are experts in handling furniture to make sure your delivery goes as smoothly as possible. This service is a 'white glove' service and includes the following:
Confirmation of your two-hour delivery window the working day before your agreed delivery date
An estimated time of arrival on the day of delivery (this is a guide not a guarantee due to traffic and possible difficulties in earlier deliveries which are out of our control)
Two man delivery team
Unpack and position the furniture in the room of your choice
Remove and recycle packaging
We ask that you check the dimensions at the delivery address for access (including doors, corridors and stairs) as well as the area of intended use, before you order to ensure that the product is the right size for you and to enable us to deliver your order successfully.  You must provide a clear route to the room of choice removing any obstacles from the exterior and communal areas.  Goods that fail to fit into your property at the point of delivery are your responsibility as we have no control over this.  Please also advise us of any parking restrictions, red routes or width restrictions ahead of the delivery.
Access Checks
If you are looking to buy a sofa but concerned that it might not fit through your doorway or stairwell then it's worth considering using our access check service.  For an additional fee a trained member of our team will visit your home to measure up, giving you piece of mind before you buy.
Get in touch
to find out pricing and further details.
Removal of existing furniture
As part of the white glove service we can also remove your old furniture for an extra fee, which must be arranged with us prior to delivery.  We reserve the right to refuse collection of unhygienic furniture for health and safety reasons.  Please
get in touch
to find out further details.
RETURNS
We offer a no quibble returns policy* - so you are fully entitled to a refund within 14 working days of delivery.
*except for the products described below referred to as made-to-order or those in our Outlet/Clearance collection.
Please
get in touch
with us if you wish to return an item and we will advise how best to proceed hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk |
01732 490851
.
We ask that the product you return is in new, unused, condition with all the original packaging and product tags still attached.  For small accessory items being returned by post or courier, we advise you use an insured, signed for service in case the parcel fails to reach us.  Unfortunately we cannot cover the cost of return postage, unless the item is faulty.
Someday Designs reserve the right to refuse a refund on any item if we find that the product has not been returned to us in fully resalable condition.
All accurately returned products will be credited to the original purchaser’s credit or debit card, excluding delivery costs, within 7 working days once received and checked. We will email you confirmation once the refund has been made.
Damaged or faulty items
We make every effort to deliver your items to you in perfect condition. We recommend that you check your delivery as soon as it is received. If there is a problem with your order please
contact
hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk |
01732 490851
as soon as possible so that we can resolve it for you promptly. We may ask you to send images of the fault and it is advisable to keep the original packaging in which the item arrived.
Returns Procedure for Furniture Orders Only
Should you wish to return a furniture item we will arrange to collect this item from you and will apply an appropriate collection charge, which will be deducted from the refund value when processed. To arrange a collection please
contact
our team hello@somedaydesigns.co.uk |
01732 490851
.
Products, which fall into the following categories, will not be refunded unless they are proven to be faulty;
Any goods made to order or not normally kept in stock at Someday Designs (see more information below)
Self assembly furniture cannot be returned once assembly is part or fully completed
Made-to-order products
Due to the bespoke nature of the products we supply and the diverse choice of finishes and materials, goods are often made-to-order by our design partners and imported from overseas.  Therefore it is not possible to return these items.
We will contact you via email to confirm your made-to-order details to ensure all specifications are completely correct before we place the order with the supplier. Following delivery, made-to-order goods are non-returnable unless we have not supplied the correct item or specification as per the order confirmation email.
Made-to-order pieces are sofas, furniture and lighting items whereby you select a fabric, colour, material finish or size at point of order.

Pride in Bench-Built Craftsmanship
Our painted furniture is the best in class. Our builders hand-select each piece of wood that makes it into a Maine Cottage piece of furniture. Every chair, bed, and dresser—each is built one at a time start to finish at a single workbench by a single craftsman who has complete ownership and pride in the finished result. Every square inch of the furniture is hand sanded to a smooth finish.

Why We Shine
The sanding between coats is the labor-intensive step that sets our smooth finish apart. Finishers are meticulously trained to leave enough shine to allow for easy maintenance but not so much that it becomes highly reflective and susceptible to finger printing. Our paint finish also knows how to age gracefully. Over the years, it develops a patina of surface scratches that add to the charm of our furniture’s cottage style.

PRODUCT CARE
Rotomolded Plastic
General Cleaning:
Rinse with clean water and dry with a clean, soft cloth. Avoid using abrasive cleanser that may scratch the plastic. Use a tub/tile/sink cleaner; non-abrasive, all-purpose cleaner; or a paste of baking soda and water. Apply the cleaner to the surface or on a damp sponge and rub gently. The plastic injection moulding process produces large numbers of parts of high quality with great accuracy, very quickly. Plastic material in the form of granules is melted until soft enough to be injected under pressure to fill a mould. The result is that the shape is exactly copied. Kannoa products are UV Resistant, and in this case Recyclable.
Simplicity and Style
Designed for durability, practicality and style.

Testimonials
Great buying experience at Euro living. Wide selection of contemporary furniture. Staff specifically Claudia has been great at answering all our questions and going through all our concerns patiently. Would definitely recommend buying here.
Sree V
I recently had the pleasure of shopping at Euro Living, and I must say, it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The moment I walked in, I was greeted with a warm smile and a sense of tranquility in their beautifully designed store. The selection of furniture and home decor was not only extensive but also of remarkable quality.

What truly set Euro Living apart was their customer service. Edyd was incredibly knowledgeable and went above and beyond to help me find the perfect pieces to complement my home. Their personalized recommendations made the process so much easier.
Lisa Martinez
Love the selection they have and Scott was very helpful in assisting us. He was great at responding to my questions and keeping me updated on the status of my order. Their delivery team did a wonderful job and we're so helpful while setting up the entire room. I highly recommend this store if you're looking for quality and great customer service!
Zeny Patel
We live in San Antonio and found the perfect rug for our home. The staff was easy to work with and helped us make sure we found the correct size. Scott Nguyen made everything go so smoothly. I recommend you check out this store if you are a lover of contemporary furnishings.
Susan Wampler
This is the perfect store to get everything you need for your home. Beautiful high quality furnitures. Edyd is professional, passionate and sweet so ask for her help. Highly recommended!

Shipping & Returns
Shipping Options
At QW Furniture, we offer four different options for getting your new furniture to you:
Free In-Store Pickup:
Pick up your purchase at our store, free of charge.
Local Delivery:
Enjoy a two-man, white glove delivery service if you reside within our local delivery radius.
Long-Distance Curbside Delivery:
Available for a flat rate of $199, this service is for customers living outside our local delivery radius. This includes unloading your furniture onto your curb or driveway.
Long-Distance In-Home Delivery:
For a flat rate of $399, this white-glove, in-home delivery experience is available for customers outside our local delivery radius. This includes complete in-home delivery and removal of waste packaging materials. Please note that our delivery teams will not remove old furniture. Please have the room ready and prepared for your new furniture to arrive.
Depending on your delivery location, long distance delivery will take an additional 2-4 weeks.
Please note, your delivery location must be accessible by semi-trailer and be clear of snow. Also, please ensure that your order will fit through your doorways and stairways to avoid restocking fees. For any shipment delays, storage and/or transfer fees may apply. Our delivery teams are unable to deliver via ferries. Customer will be responsible for coordinating with ferry transportation and fees associated. Please contact us for more details regarding ferry transportation.
Apartment/Condo Deliveries:
Please contact us directly if your building needs a Certificate of Insurance (COI) and/or proof of Workman's Comp. We will need an example of the COI to provide the necessary documentation. There is a $100 fee for processing fees for
each
piece of documentation. Please contact us if you have questions regarding a COI/Workman's Comp for your building.
Furniture Inspection
We work only with experienced drivers and ensure our Amish Furniture is heavily wrapped during the shipping and delivery process. We also carefully inspect each item prior to delivery. It is your responsibility to inspect the furniture upon delivery and report any damage while the delivery is taking place. QW Furniture will not be held liable for any damage to personal property, not including the furniture being delivered, that is alleged to have occurred during the delivery process.
Return Requests
Given our furniture is custom-built, a 30% restocking fee applies for returns. Requests must be submitted within 7 days of receipt. Shipping charges are non-refundable and customers are responsible for return shipping costs. Certain items, such as gift cards, stains, and mattresses, cannot be returned.
Refunds
Once your return is received and inspected, you will be notified of the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, the refund will be processed to your original payment method within a certain number of days. For late or missing refunds, please contact us at
sales@qualitywoods.com
.
Return Shipping
To return your product, ship your item to: 1231 Hwy 52 North, Rochester Minnesota 55901. Please note that return shipping costs are non-refundable and will be deducted from your refund.
Order Terms
Payment & Financing:
We understand that investing in hand-crafted furniture is significant. We offer the flexibility of starting your order with a deposit of just 30% of the order value. When you start your order with a 30% deposit, the remaining balance is due when your furniture is out of production. The remaining balance may be automatically charged to the card information on file. To place an order with a 30% deposit, call us at
507-289-6866
or checkout online and select '30% Deposit' under Purchase Options when you add an item to cart. Some products that ship within 8 weeks do not qualify for our deposit payment program.
Build Times:
Once your purchase is finalized with QW Furniture, your order goes directly into production. See individual product pages for detailed estimates of build times. Our posted build times are estimates and are not guaranteed. Remember, our furniture is handcrafted and must pass rigorous quality checks. Build time delays do not permit cancellation. Note that our build time may be extended over holidays due to our craftsmen and women taking time to be with their families.
Order Changes:
You can make changes to your order up to 48 hours from order placement without a fee. Changes after this time frame will incur a $100 change fee, plus any stoppage fees related to parts already ordered or cut, and hardware ordered.
Cancellations:
You may cancel your order up to 48 hours after placing it for a full refund. Cancellation requests after 48 hours may not be accepted, and a 30% restocking fee may apply.
Shipping & Delivery:
Please refer to our
Shipping & Returns page
for complete information.
Furniture Inspection:
All of our furniture is securely wrapped in blankets during shipping and delivery. It is your responsibility to inspect your furniture upon delivery to ensure there is no damage.
Hand Crafted Furniture:
Each piece of our furniture is handcrafted, with unique grain patterns and characteristics. No two pieces of furniture are exactly alike. We offer stain samples to visualize the finish in your home, understanding that finish colors will vary. For other product questions, please visit our
FAQ Page
or
Contact Us
.
Return Requests:
Given our furniture is custom-built, a 30% restocking fee applies to all returns. We accept return requests within 7 days of receiving your furniture. Shipping charges are non-refundable and you will be responsible for return shipping charges. Certain items, such as gift cards, stain, and mattresses cannot be returned.
Refunds:
Upon receiving and inspecting your returned item, we will notify you of the approval or rejection of your refund. If approved, a refund will be issued to your original payment method within a certain number of days.
Product Protection:
We offer a comprehensive Furniture Protection Program in partnership with Guardsman. Learn more on our
Guardsman Protection Plan page
.
Warranty:
All our products come with a one-year warranty covering manufacturing defects and workmanship errors. This warranty does not cover commercial use, normal wear and tear, or wood expansion and contraction caused by uncontrolled humidity conditions.

About CH24 Wishbone Chair - Beech - Soft colours
The CH24 Soft from Carl Hansen is a gentle variation on Hans J. Wegner’s Wishbone Chair from 1950.
Just like the original, the special edition is timelessly elegant with its clean and characteristic expression.
The new finish has an inviting quality that tempts your hand to stroke the backrest, and Furthermore, the coating makes it easier to maintain the chair, keeping the timeless design looking even cleaner.
Think of CH24 Soft as a gentle counterpart to a Wishbone Chair with a brighter finish. Or maybe as a subtle contrast to Hans J. Wegner’s CH327 dining table in soap-treated beech.

Perfect for us!
We have an 80” tv and found it hard to find something that was big enough for balance. This is a beautiful piece of furniture that came assembled and was easy to put up.
E
Eric
Unique and well made
Just what I was looking for, a minimalist and stylish floating TV stand. A unique blend of modern styling and a distressed finish, with clean lines and a nice range of grey and brown tones. It always draws the attention of guests who want to know where I found it. My 1970's walls are not very straight, and that did present some challenges when mounting. The included french cleat mounts are super strong. Be forewarned, the shelves must be installed BEFORE you mount the unit to your wall. They don't fit in from the front. This also means they can't be removed if you decide you don't need them, but they can be adjusted.

Dan
Exactly what I wanted
Good quality and something I can mount to the wall. Exactly what I was looking for!
S
Speranza
Perfect!
Very please with my purchase! The floating stand is beautifully made. Very good quality. Definitely purchasing more pieces to add in my home.

High Quality and Value, Excellent Cust Service!
Very high quality and value floating AV cabinet that actually fits a large 36"" center speaker. Install was easy and customer service was very responsive as I was asking questions about the product, etc.

DISAINITUD JA TOODETUD EESTIS
OLEME EESTI DISAINISTUUDIO
Skandinaavialik stiilitunnetus, puhtad ja ajatud vormid on kindlasti märksõnad, mis iseloomustavad meie mööblit. Disainiprotsessis oleme pühendunud ja põhjalikud. Näiteks Voog tugitoolist valmistasime pea poolsada prototüüpi, kuni jõudsime vormi- ja disainitäiuseni, mis annab edasi meie visiooni – tugitool, mis näeb hea välja, kuid on sealjuures ütlemata mugav.
Diivanid ja tugitoolid olgu ilusad, kuid sama tähtis on ka mööbli ergonoomika. Iga inimene on erinev ja samuti on erinevad ka inimeste istumisharjumused ja ootused mugavusele. Mõnele sobib jäik ja hästi selga toetav diivan, teisele jälle võimalikult pehme sohva. Seda kõike arvestame tootearendusprotsessis, et jõuda parima tasakaaluni esteetika ja funktsionaalsuse vahel.

Leg Finish Options
How Our Armchairs Are Made
We build our armchairs up from a hardwood beech frame, using traditional methods and materials. With hand-tied coil-sprung seat, arms and back.
Where cushions are used, what makes them so comfortable is the high down content (50% down, 50% feather in seat, and 70% down, 30% feather in back). The down gives the cushions lovely softness, while the feathers provide loft and spring.
​
Where castors are used, they have been individually hand-cast by traditional English metal crafters to a very high standard, and a variety of finishes can be achieved. We use the antique brass finish as standard.
Where legs are used, they can be either tapered or turned and come in a variety of woods and finishes (see 'Leg Options' tab for more details). We use medium oak as standard.
All of our furniture can be made completely bespoke. We want this to be your perfect armchair, so if you want it a bit bigger or smaller, softer or firmer, or anything else just ask we will do our best to accommodate.
The price excludes fabric. If you need some help finding the perfect fabric, let us know.
Fabric quantities for standard models in plain fabric are shown in the product description.
F
or patterns, and bespoke sizes, get in touch and we can advise on fabric quantity.

Shipping & Lead Times
The Banyan Tree requires a
street address
for all deliveries, unfortunately
we do not deliver to PO boxes. D
eliveries are ONLY door to door
and not brought into the premise unless stated otherwise.
Please note that rubbish removal, assembly, placement or unpacking of goods are
not included
in your shipping quote unless stated otherwise.
Contactless Click & Collect
available in our Camberwell Showroom (Victoria) for ALL items, free.
Free Delivery
for specific collections only, such as Ethnicraft.
Flat Rates:
We offer the following flat shipping rates:
$10 for all homewares and smaller items,
$70 for all framed prints, canvases, mirrors and larger pieces
PLEASE NOTE THIS IS FOR FULL PRICE ITEMS ONLY.
For
sale items
, we will contact you directly and provide a quote at competitive prices, however this only applies to metro areas within Australia. We want to ensure your goods arrive safely and with the least chance of damage, so in most cases we will use specialised furniture couriers which may come at a higher price.
If for any reason you cannot be present to accept delivery or if you wish for goods to be left in a safe place unattended, you must clearly make note of this when placing your order. Note:
Authority to leave
goods unattended will void all transit insurance claims. The Banyan Tree is not liable for theft, damages or loss resulting from your goods being left unattended.
*In the occurrence of a faulty item please report it to us within 48 hours of receiving the item.
Pick up
from our Camberwell Showroom is always an option, and it’s free!
Customer pickups on large pieces are done so at the bearer's responsibility and damage claims will not be accepted.
Lead times
can vary depending on the item, from as little as 1 week or as long as 16 weeks depending on manufacturing and shipping times. An order confirmation will be sent to your email immediately after you place your order, and you will be further advised within 2-5 business days on an estimated time of arrival for your item(s).
We will strive to deliver your items within the specified timeframe, however please note that lead times are an estimate only and they may change due to circumstances beyond our control.
SOLID TIMBER DISCLAIMER
Product images are for illustration purposes only and may differ from the actual product.
You should expect colour, grain and other natural imperfections and variations on natural timber pieces, which is what gives them a unique charm.
These will not  be considered damaged pieces.
It is not possible to
request a certain colour as all pieces come in their own individual colour and finish. No two pieces will ever be the same.
With solid timber pieces, we can never guarantee 100% that split/cracks will not occur.

Our signature solid teak bench is exclusive to Living by Design in Australia, as featured on the front cover of
Country Style Magazine
and in
House and Garden
editorials. A perfect blend of modern country, meets simple nordic functionality. The clean solid lines complement the organic natural curve of the seat, ensuring no two are the same.
The hardwood teak is very lightly oiled and sustainably sourced. While the wood is of superior quality, teak naturally allows for knots or slight discolouration. Our design partners hand cut and re-fill knots in the bench top according to Living by Design's specifications. Each of our teak tops vary in this process, and we do not consider these variations to be faults.
An ideal bench for the narrow hallway, simple nook, or end of bed. Our extensive size range will ensure a perfect size is available. Our exclusive Sorensen Teak bench with its slender silhouette, is the ideal addition to large or small spaces... indoor or outdoor.

Order Cancellations
You may cancel your order for any reason before shipment for a full refund. Please contact our Customer Service representatives at 305-224-1991 to verify if the order can be successfully canceled.

How soon will it ship?
How quickly will I get my order? (production or lead time)
At Oak For Less® furniture, we offer furniture from many different builders.  Some are right here in Phoenix, AZ, while others are in California, or the midwest like Illinois or Indiana.  Many of our domestic items are made-to-order and are built when the order is placed, so their production time is a little longer than others.  We also offer a selection of items that are imported, so they often have quicker production times since those items are already made.
Since lead times can vary, we give an estimated range.  These lead times are
APPROXIMATE
, they are
NOT EXACT
.  Items may arrive early or unexpected delays can occur with builders and/or shippers.  These situations are beyond our control.  By placing an order, the customer agrees that they understand the production time is our
best estimate
.  When the order is ready for In-Store Pick Up or Local Delivery, you will receive a call to schedule it.
Current estimated lead time is per builder item # prefix
.
For example, item FD-3051T has an ""FD-"" at the beginning of its item #.  On our list below, FD- items have a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks.  So item FD-3051T has a lead time of 10 - 14 weeks.  Please remember this is an ESTIMATE and many factors can affect it.
If your delivery location is
outside of Arizona please add at least 2 weeks extra
to these estimates to allow for the shipper's scheduling and routing delivery arrangements.  Also, i
f the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time.

and include the items that you are interested in as well as the delivery city, state, and zip code and we will get you a delivery quote.
Delivery services are made by experienced independent contractors. Delivery is available if the customer is located within designated delivery areas. Delivery contractors do their best to be careful when delivering furniture, but in the event damage occurs to walls, flooring, etc., the customer will take up any issues solely with the independent contractor.
Customers must have the room ready for the delivery when it is scheduled.
Delivery does NOT include moving old furniture or electronic devices such as TVs or audio/video components. If you ask them to do extra work, they will charge extra.
With any delivery method, the customer is responsible for making sure that the items will fit through their hallways and into the room of choice. If the driver cannot easily deliver it to the room of choice (narrow hallways/tight turns/low ceilings/is asked to move other furniture) there will be additional cost that must be paid to the delivery service at the time of the delivery. Regardless if the furniture fits into the room of choice or does not, the customer is still responsible for paying the delivery fee, it is not refundable.
If the delivery location is in a remote location or an area not easily reached by the delivery service, it may take an extended delivery time.
Blanket Wrap delivery (states outside of Arizona)
:
Blanket Wrap delivery starts at $395 and goes up depending on the item(s) and delivery area.  To be sure of the delivery cost for your area, please contact our store and ask for a precise delivery quote.  Different blanket wrap delivery services serve different areas, so this delivery includes bringing the item(s) inside and either putting them in the first dry area (threshold delivery) or depending on the shipper for your area into the room of choice (1st floor only) - it depends on the service for your area.
If your delivery requires stairs or steps or an elevator, we need to know in advance at the time of order because some shippers will not do stairs
. Stairs or elevators may require an additional charge, it all depends upon which shipper it is.
If you order a platform bed, Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, and also includes up to 30 minutes of assembling the platform bed.
If you order a table, Blanket Wrap delivery includes putting it in the room of choice, first floor, but it does not include assembly of the table.  If you require table assembly, please contact us at the time of order because some shippers will not do assembly.
This may require an additional charge, depending on the shipper.
Please note that Blanket Wrap
delivery does NOT include
attaching or reversing hardware or
installing and arranging adjustable shelves inside of a bookcase or cabinet as this can be time consuming
.
It also does NOT include attaching a headboard to a customer's existing bedframe as the hole locations that need to be drilled into the headboard can vary depending on the existing bedframe
.
Blanket Wrap delivery outside of Arizona is a one or two person delivery.
An adult must be at the residence to sign for and accept the item(s) in good condition.
Basic delivery (within Arizona only)
:
Basic delivery covers areas within Arizona only.  Basic delivery within Arizona
starts
at $95
and goes up depending on the item(s), if set up is needed, and the delivery area
.  Basic delivery includes the following: Placement inside the home - first floor, no stairs. This is usually a one-person delivery - the customer may be asked to assist the driver.  This delivery does not include unpacking, debris removal, assembly, nor set up. For delivery upstairs or downstairs or if you need set-up, please contact our store at phone number
480-962-9930

Moo is a full scale wall–mounted Norwegian moose head light. Moo may be used for both indoor and outdoor decoration. The figuratively shaped lamp body is made of poly–resin material, that gives a smooth and transparent flow of light. The bulbs placed inside the horns add extra elements of soft, sparkling and translucent light effects to the lamp.
The inspiration behind the Moo lamp was found in northern Norway, –in the breathtaking scenery of Hamarøy, where both designers have summer houses. Here the moose is frequently seen passing close to the houses and even on the lawns. The designers hope Moo will stand out as a post–modern kitch trophy, making the viewer smile happily as they recognize this “King of the Norwegian forest”.

Explore the
Modern Furniture
Range
At Modern Furniture, we believe that décor is about more than just appearances. It's about creating a certain feel in your interior spaces – a feeling of sophistication, elegance, and style.
...
With an ever-growing range of contemporary furniture, Modern Furniture is your one-stop shop for all your furniture needs. From the latest in contemporary dining tables and chairs to the latest in living room furniture, we have it all.
With a massive range of styles available online and in-store, we’re your one-stop shop for all your furniture needs. So, what are you waiting for? Browse our exclusive, designer range today.
Your Online Furniture Store in Australia
When it comes to contemporary style, there is a lot to explore at our online furniture store. We offer a wide range of design choices, from sofas and coffee tables, to office furniture and lounge chairs. We also offer a range of accessories, such as lamps, rugs and cushions, to complete the look.
We’re an Australian family-owned business that designs and manufactures our own designer furniture, then delivers it nationwide. Here at our store, there are two main styles of furniture design: mid-century modern and contemporary. Mid-century style is characterised by its clean lines, simple forms, and natural materials. Contemporary furniture, on the other hand, is more often defined by its use of bold colours, patterns, and artwork, as well as cutting-edge materials.
We celebrate both of these here at Modern Furniture. We travel the world looking for beautiful decor, with a range of timeless pieces crafted from quality materials. Browse our exclusive collection today.
So Which is the Right Style of Furniture for You?
It really depends on your personal taste and the overall aesthetic you're going for. Whether you’re creating a cosy feel in your home, or going for a professional look at the office, we have everything you need to make a great first impression.
Of course, you don't have to choose just one style. Mixing and matching different pieces is a great way to put together an eclectic look and create a truly unique space. You’re only limited by your imagination. Check out our range for inspiration today to get started.
Stunning Contemporary Furniture in Australia
No matter what your personal style, you're sure to find something you love at Modern Furniture. We carry a wide range of both mid-century modern and contemporary furniture, so you're sure to find the perfect piece for your home.

Perfect!

I needed something very specific and scoured the internet to see if it existed. I was a little leery of ordering site unseen, but the process could not have been better. From communication with the company before the purchase, the purchase process itself, the color choices to delivery, everything was smooth. And the quality of the piece itself is top notch.
You all are terrific!
5 star rating
We really love it! Having drawers that are custom for DVDs or CDs is fabulous! We enjoy having the lights on every evening. Thank you for making my design come to life!  The quality is incomparable. We could never find anything close to this in a regular furniture store. You all are terrific!
Beautiful

Well worth the wait for something that will last a lifetime. They are very professional to work with and the quality is outstanding. Delivery was perfect and very professional. They knew just what to do to assemble this piece on site. I thank you all!
Wonderful Piece!
5 star rating
I just received our customized Cancun console (we had ordered it 10"" longer, 5"" of length added to each of the end cabinets) and it is spectacular! The whole console is extremely heavy and solid in the best possible way, and it just looks fantastic. We had it done in brown maple with the Kettle Black finish which is a great color with the most subtle hint of wood grain visible underneath, really nice! I can't recommend this piece enough, the entire ordering/customization process through Countryside was seamless.
We love it. Well made,

The quality of the entertainment center provided by Countryside Amish Furniture helped complete our home, fitting in perfectly with the surrounding furniture. Beautifully finished, it was more than we hoped for!
Beautiful and well made
5 star rating
The elm cabinet that I received from Countryside Amish Furniture was delivered right on time by two lovely gents who put it in place and set it up just right. It is absolutely flawless, handsome, and very well made. Very pleased with this company and the product.
Absolutely Beautiful
5 star rating
We just received our dining room table and entertainment TV stand and they are absolutely beautiful. The quality of your work is amazing and just what I was looking for. Going online to do this was a little scary but your furniture is exactly as listed.

Thank you very much for our beautiful furniture.
Exceeded Expectations
5 star rating
Lauren, our sales consultant was extremely helpful in selecting the exact finish for our TV console and purchasing an additional shelf to improve the utility of the console. The console is very well made and is exactly as pictured on the Countryside website. Delivery went smoothly. The delivery team arrived exactly as scheduled, placed our console in our great room, unwrapped, and set it up.

Welcome to ikonitaly!
All our beautiful and wonderful iconic pieces can be shipped worldwide!
Delivery costs, duty fees and taxes
Standard delivery is to street level
and all our products travel with a shipping insurance. In addition, at the time of the order, you can ask for an extra assembly service. Our Customer Service will let you know if this option is available for your country.
The shipping fee for delivery of standard products will be calculated at checkout. In some cases, an extra shipping cost may be applicable such as for voluminous packages or non-standard orders, for certain countries, on particular products and for brands based on certain commercial conditions. This cost will be communicated to you so that you can decide if you would like to finalize the purchase. However, should you prefer to receive a personalized quote, just get in touch with us at (+39) 392-5784041 or send us your request by e-mail to
info@ikonitaly.com
.
It is the buyer’s responsibility to pay duty fees, import taxes and any other clearance charges for the package to be delivered to the final destination. These costs will be comunicated to you by the courier once the item arrives in your country.
We normally deliver the products included in your order all together. If you prefer, and whenever it is possible, we will ship the products in stock immediately. Please send us an e-mail with your special request at
info@ikonitaly.com
.
In order to give you the best possible service, we rely on trusted international couriers which are able to guarantee a tracking code for your delivery, such as DHL, TNT EXPRESS, UPS, FEDEX. We also deliver freight via sea for bulky items and large orders so as to accomodate your needs & budget. Kindly
get in touch
with us, we will be happy to prepare a personalized quote for you.
We deliver worldwide with international couriers generally within 4-8 working days from the moment that the item is made available in our warehouse. This estimated time may vary during the period of national holidays and from August 1 to August 30. The delivery time via sea can vary between 2 – 5 weeks, depending on the destination.
Products in stock are normally dispatched within 2 days. The estimated time for dispatching products not in stock varies for each item. We will notify you as soon as the information is made available to us.
Picking up the merchandise from our showroom
You can book an appointment to pick up from our warehouse any product that we have in stock, even when the final destination is outside the European Union. In this case, the invoice will not include VAT and the customer will be entirely responsible for the export declaration.
ikonitalys.r.l.s. will only accept couriers that specialize in shipping outside the EU, thus refusing any personal pickup or the service of a national courier. Our Customer Service will be authorized to contact the courier chosen by the customer to verify that the actual destination is outside the EU and will also be able to suspend the order until the customer pays the VAT where applicable, which will then be reimbursed once the export documents have been sent to ikonitaly s.r.l.s as proof.
Tracking
Once your order has been picked up for shipping, you will receive an email with the courier name and tracking number, so you can follow your order during the delivery.
Damage in transit
Our team will make sure to check every item in your order so that it is carefully packaged for national and international deliveries. However, parcels may get damaged during transit so we kindly ask you to check the products very carefully upon receipt.
What to do in case you receive a damaged good?
Upon receipt of your package, we recommend you carefully check every item while the courier is still with you. Should you receive a damaged good, please sign the delivery slip with the annotation “product damaged - broken” and refuse to accept the goods. Please contact our Customer Service within 4 days upon receiving your order by sending an email at
info@ikonitaly.com
. Our team will get back to you immediately with instructions on how to proceed.
You accepted the goods despite our recommendation and they happen to be damaged. What do I do now?

The
Chieut
table, a contemporary low table, has been described as the quintessential minimalist design project. Originally conceived by Swedish based South Korean designer Jay Design in 2012, this beautiful ethereal piece seems to defy the law of gravity. The
Chieut
has attracted the praise of leading architectural luminaries such as the
Zaha Hadid Architects
and was the recipient of the prestigious
Golden A' Design Award in 2017
.
The
Chieut
table is entirely handcrafted in Italy
by design atelier Minimaproject
with the finest materials in a limited edition of 200 pieces to guarantee the uniqueness of each piece. Both body and legs can be ordered in a number of powder coating colour finishes to obtain interesting cromatic combinations. Small imperfections might be present-evidence that our pieces are unique and not mass produced.
Dimensions: 100 x 56,5 x h40,5 cm

Voices of Design Lovers
Beautifully designed and built
We are as happy as can be with our two new Altek baba dining chairs. After finding two in oak at a vintage fair I searched far and wide to find more of these very comfortable and sleek chairs. The price was reasonable and we love them in walnut.
JMC
Absolutely STUNNING
Luke and his team went above and beyond ensuring my client's product was safely and swiftly replaced when the first delivery underwent a huge mishap -- the leather of the laundry basket, the craftsmanship, the weight -- all surpassed expectations. We will definitely be continuing doing our business with ikonitaly and using our pieces to elevate the homes of our clients.
Emily
Absolutely gorgeous
I purchased two sets of single, double seat and a table. They look amazing, very well made and sturdy. Came very securely packaged. The best testimony for this furniture is that, as soon as it arrived, I purchased another set! Fantastic. Thank you x

Designed to be different. Table top Art work. Ceramic pottery with a twist.
Cathal
Beautiful but low quality
Considering the price and the design, I was expecting a higher quality in the material.
Denise
Great customer care and fast delivery
It was my first time ordering from ikonitaly; I was impressed by the selection of designer furniture and accessories available. Customer service was very efficient and arranged fast delivery to Malta. Very happy with our carpet choice, thanks!

Based in Walker, Newcastle upon Tyne, Walter Cox Ltd has been a family business for 107 years. It was Walter Cox himself who started the business as a watch maker in 1918 after he'd served in the First World War, the shop was originally based in Church Street then moved to the current site on Welbeck Road in 1935. Douglas Cox took over from him followed by David Cox, Walter's sons.  David and his wife, Kathleen, retired 16 years ago and now Samantha, their daughter, and her husband John, run the shop.  Over the years the shop has sold many different products including paint, prams, clothes and shoes. Long before Netflix and Firesticks, you could forget about Blockbusters, Walter Cox was the place to go for all your rental videos.
Through the years the shop has changed what it sells to keep up with current trends and fashions, one thing that has not changed is the pride we take in our customer service to all our existing and new customers.
Today the shop sells a wide range of household furniture, beds, carpets and household electricals from leading brands such as Hotpoint, Indesit, Whirlpool, Lifestyle Floors, Dura Beds and Julian Bowen.

Fabric Wardrobe, Foldable Closet with Hanging Rail, Clothes Rack, Storage Organiser for Bags, Toys, Shoes, Living Room, Bedroom, Cloakroom, 150 x 45 x 175 cm.
INVITE YOUR CLOTHES IN: Hang your clothes on the 2 rods of the fabric wardrobe in neat rows. Place your folded clothes on the shelves. When you need to pick your outfits for a big day, everything you have is just at your fingertips.
IT HAS THE STRENGTH: The hanging rail has a load capacity of 15 kg and the fabric layer holds 5 kg because it’s supported by 16 mm dia. metal tubes and quality non-woven fabric; the sturdiness and durability of the foldable closet are both assured.
AWAY FROM DUST: Your favorite new garment needs better protection. The fabric cover, equipped with a zipper and hook-and-loop fasteners, was handpicked to store your clothes properly. This clothes rack has you covered!
EASY TO ASSEMBLE: No more spending hours putting a fabric wardrobe together; the assembly here is all about attaching the tubes into the plastic connectors, no tools required. All that’s left to do is display your shirts and dresses on the hanging rail.

What an amazing company. I made an appointment and visited the  warehouse today, and I am excited  about  my purchase.  The customer service I received from John was TOP-NOTCH!!!  They have a vast selection of impressive products at an amazing price point.  I purchased my first two products today and,  I changed my mind on one item, so I requested  a change order a few hours later, after hours. They were so responsive that they already made the change I requested (seamlessly)and have kept my order on track!  I suspect/hope  this is the begining of of a very long and loyal  customer relationship.  The delivery was fast and perfect. The couch is smart looking!  The bookshelves are also attractive   and weren't too difficult to assemble. Thank you  Muuduu!!!

Call and placed an order today 4/12/17 at 12:30pm.....  After reading the reviews I advised the woman on the phone that I can see some people were not happy with the time it took to receive their order.  She assured me that wouldn't be the case and I will have my table and chairs this Saturday or for sure, next Saturday......
True to her word, my furniture arrived on the Saturday. Very well packaged and exactly as described. Great company, excellent prices, you will not find items cheaper anywhere else! Highly recommend for all furniture purchases!

My ordering/delivery experience with Muuduu was amazing. I ordered my dining room table and less than a week later received a call letting me know what day/time window it would be delivered. I received a call from the driver stating he would be there within 30 minutes of the time window starting. Just like clockwork he was there within 30 minutes. Once arrived both delivery associates kindly brought my table upstairs. They were very nice and friendly as well. The day after delivery I received a follow up call to make sure everything was perfect. Customer service was 110%!!!

We have ordered a beautiful table for our kitchen and a Bedroom set for a guest room. I get numerous compliments on each time after time. I have recommended Muuduu to several friends and family.
If you compare the prices at Muuduu you will quickly order from them, for the value, quality, and price.

You never know exactly what you're going to get when you order one of our Myrtlewood lazy Susans, but you are always getting your money's worth.  The variation is quite drastic as you can see in the pictures.  This is probably my most favorite wood to work with because of the surprise I get when the character finally shows through upon final sanding and lacquer coats.
The 16 inch solid Myrtle lazy susan comes standard with a 6"" steel swivel base.  Premium swivel base upgrades are available.  Click

MATERIAL
Our furniture is made of Teak Wood grown in plantations in Java, Indonesia, where the number of trees felled per year is strictly monitored by the Indonesian government. In adhering to such regulations, our factories are certified by the Rainforest Alliance and the SVLK.
As Teak Wood is a natural material, no two pieces are alike. The rings, grains and patterns of a tree are all different, just like how humans have different fingerprints.
More information can be found on
our teak articles
.
CARE INSTRUCTIONS
We have prepared some
general tips for caring for your Teak furniture here
.
For shelves and chest of drawers, it is recommended to place heavier items on lower shelves/drawers, and to avoid opening all (or more than two) drawers at the same time due to a shift in center of gravity which may cause chests of drawers to fall forward.
For homes with children, please take care to ensure that children do not climb on furniture, including (but not limited to) shelves/chests of drawers.
Most of our cushion covers can be Dry Cleaned and Machine/hand Washed (water temperature should not exceed 30 degrees Celsius). Dry cleaning solvent should not contain trichloroethylene. Please do not Bleach or Tumble Dry them, as this can lead to discolouration or shrinking. For ironing, please use low heat.
Please note that these instructions do not apply to cushion covers from the Holm Designer range (for the 2015 edition only), which should be wiped down with a damp cloth and dried in the sun.
You can also view our
product care guide
for more details.
Delivery
Standard Furniture Delivery charges will apply to all orders below S$2,000, and are charged per trip per address, at S$60 (Weekdays) / S$80 (Saturdays). Orders above $2,000 can be delivered for free.
We regret to inform that we are unable to cater to CONDOMINIUM DELIVERIES on Saturdays, due to the tight time window that condominium estate managements impose on large-item delivery service providers.
Items delivered via our Standard Furniture Delivery will be assembled at no additional charge. Please also note that delivery charges are non-refundable.
Deliveries to special areas (including but not limited to Sentosa, air bases and SAF camps) will incur an additional S$20 per trip. This surcharge will be collected on-site, upon delivery.
Small-sized furniture items that
do not require assembly
services can be delivered via our courier partners. Small-sized furniture items are limited to stools, small display stands, casual side tables and butler trays only.
All available delivery charges for online orders will be automatically tallied based on your cart items.
Family friendly
Teak wood is very easy to maintain, thanks to its naturally high oil content and it’s natural resistance to rain and shine. You also won’t have to panic when kids (or fur-kids) have ‘accidents’ on the bed - all
Scanteak’s sofa upholstery
is made of machine-washable woven fabric, and so are our Germany-made mattress covers!
Premium teak
Teak is a highly coveted material in carpentry and maintains its strength while still being malleable for wood works. With time, teak grows darker in colour, slowly developing into a beautiful golden-brown.
Low formaldehyde
SCANTEAK is recognised as one of the brands under the
Singapore Furniture Industries Council (SFIC)'s Sustainability Furniture Mark
, under the formaldehyde category. We’ve met strict standards to ensure that our furniture emits only minimal levels of formaldehyde, keeping your indoor environment healthier.
Sustainably sourced
All our teak wood is sourced from suppliers who comply with the SVLK (Indonesia's timber legality assurance system), which ensures that our wood is sustainable and responsibly harvested.
Need help?
If you have any questions, you are always welcome to contact us. We'll get back to you as soon as possible, within 24 hours on weekdays.
Shipping Information
Small items can be delivered via courier, starting from $10.
Standard furniture deliveries start at $60 per location, and your items will be assembled free of charge.
If you would like to upgrade your delivery date to a Saturday ($80), please contact us via the live chat.
For any other charges related to deliveries, please
visit our FAQ here
.
Certified low formaldehyde
We believe that furniture made for the family should be safe for everyone - from seniors to kids, and even fur kids!

to have negligible levels, so you can focus on enjoying your family moments.

Online orders will automatically be scheduled for the earliest available date at the time of your order. If you have a preferred delivery date, you can let us know via the comments field during the check-out process. Kindly note however, that specifying a preferred delivery slot does not mean a slot is automatically reserved for your order.

Orders of additional cushions and/or cushion covers will require 120 days lead time, as these are made to order.
Do your items come with a warranty?
Yes, all items purchased from Scanteak come with a 6-month manufacturing warranty, which covers manufacturing defects. Differing wood grain patterns or shades are a natural occurrence in wood materials, and are not considered as defects. Damages sustained from usage are not covered. Please note that moving an item to another delivery address, installation of locks on drawers or drilling of extra holes voids this warranty.
Can I cancel my order?
Yes, however please note that cancellation requests must be made within three days of your order. For more about cancellations, please refer to
our terms of use here
. Any changes to items ordered must be made at least 4 days prior to your scheduled delivery date.
One of my furniture pieces needs to be repaired. Do you provide such services?

Live Chat
, please provide us pictures for reference, along with your sales order number, or telephone number provided at the time of your purchase.
Please also leave us your email address
so that we may create a service ticket for correspondence with you. We seek your understanding that we only provide repair services for furniture purchased from Scanteak, and reserve the right to refuse services for furniture that has been deemed to be purchased from other furniture retailers.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
Do you have ready stock or in-stock inventory for immediate delivery?
Tired of being informed that you will have to wait for 3 months or more for the furniture that you have selected? Fret not, you have found the right place - at Finn Avenue, we carry ready stock for all of our products which are listed as ""in-stock"" on our online store. You will no longer have to wait for the lovely furniture that you have bought for months on end. Generally we will be able to schedule your delivery for the next available slots in the coming week.
Why are the delivery dates for my customized or pre-order items changing?
Please note that the delivery time stated during the purchase of a customized or pre-order item is only an estimate and may be subjected to change. Any change could result from a potential delay in the item's production schedule, shipping schedule, or availability of components. We will inform you of any changes in the delivery schedule if a delay occurs.
How much do I have to pay for delivery?
Delivery is free-of-charge if the delivery date falls on a Wednesday or Thursday (unless it is a public holiday) for nett purchases above S$1000 (before GST) for mainland Singapore addresses. For purchases below S$1000 (before GST), there is an additional fee of S$40 + GST. If you wish to have the delivery date fall on any other day of the week, we will try our best to see if it can be arranged, and if so, a special delivery fee is payable – please refer to our Delivery Guide As a special delivery does not enjoy economies of scale, we advise our customers to go with our standard delivery days for maximum savings.
What if I need to change my delivery date?
If you need to change your delivery date, kindly notify us via email at least one week before your scheduled delivery date. We will confirm the change in delivery schedule via email, so do ensure that you have received our email acceptance. Re-delivery and administration charges will be incurred for any late notification or change that has not been accepted by us via an email confirmation.

DESCRIPTION
The SOHO HOOK is part of Zavedo's first self-designed Collection, called The Wall Collection. This is a collection of wall products that combines our appreciation for refined, practical, versatile and timeless design. For us detail, quality of material and engineering precision is key in this line.
SOHO HOOK is a sophisticated, minimalist hook designed to hold your jacket, coat, robe, towel, apron, or any home object that needs to be hung or displayed with a little style.  For use in the bedroom, bathroom, kitchen, reception, retail and commercial spaces.
The hook is a 2 piece construction with a base and a cap. The base is screwed into a wall, door or cabinet with a supplied counter sunk square head screw.  The cap threads onto the base to hide the screw.
The grooved edge detailing is more than aesthetic, its purpose is to provide extra grip for items that would be draped over the edge.
DESIGN IDEAS
Mix and match colours and diameters for a look random look.
Use 3 for balance and harmony.
The SOHO 50 can be used for cabinetry pullers or for a dramatic effect use the SOHO 100.
Use the SOHO 50 to hold shopping bags in any retail environment so you can display your brand with a touch of class and have the bags easily accessible.

Bewley Modern Leather Sectional With Storage
R.B.
EVEN MORE BEAUTIFUL IN PERSON!
I did a lot of research on Jubilee leather sectionals over a year before I pulled the trigger and purchased one. I most worried about the build quality, comfort and possible shipping damage after reading some negative reviews online. With that being said. I received my Bewley white Italian leather sectional (in stock) exactly 30 days including the day I ordered it to the day it was delivered (NV to OH). The ONLY issue I had was the delivery people said they would deliver it between 8 AM to 12 PM and they did not deliver it until 4:40 PM. However, they did a great job bringing in the sectional pieces and were very courteous. Definitely make sure you pay extra to have them bring the pieces in. I unwrapped the pieces and put the pieces together by myself easily. There was no shipping damage. I could not find a single defect anywhere, it was perfect and I was blown away by the build quality and it being stunningly beautiful. It is more beautiful in person than in pictures or video. You will not find a sectional anywhere else like this modern style. This is a high quality sectional. As far as comfort, it is firm being brand new. On a scale of 0 to 10 in terms of comfort, I would say a 5. However, I expected that from reading the reviews, they say the more it wears in over time the more comfortable it will get. It is not uncomfortable, just firm and when you adjust the headrest up it is more comfortable. The build quality is a 10. The white leather is not glove soft but a much more durable leather, so it should last long. Overall,  I'm very pleased and get high praise from friends and family for its beauty and aesthetic appeal. I highly recommend this Jubilee Bewley leather sectional from my experience so far.

Rileys is now West Avenue Furniture
same family, new style
Rileys Goes
West
Rileys Real Wood Furniture is growing, and we want you to know that our commitment to quality craftsmanship, top-grade materials, and customer care remains the focus of our business.
Now, in its 46th year, President Josh West (son of Riley and Lisa West) is expanding the business and taking it national with new furniture offerings, a redesigned online shopping experience, white glove delivery nationwide, and a new name. A name that represents the entire West family and the family furniture store’s origins.
Welcome to West Avenue Furniture.
Conscious | Captivating | Confident
When we began rebranding, we knew we wanted to pay homage to Rileys Real Wood Furniture, our company name for the past 24 years. So, believe us when we say deciding on a new name was quite the undertaking. We knew we wanted to honor our family business while infusing it with contemporary style and modernity. After months of brainstorming, we fell in love with West Avenue Furniture. West is our family name, and our first showroom opened on West 11th Avenue in Eugene—an actual moment of serendipity.
West Avenue Furniture’s mission is to inspire creativity and curiosity in our clients’ furniture selection. To step outside the unoriginal and be genuinely captivated by the Northwest Modern Furniture Lifestyle.

CUSTOMISATION
Please contact us if you would like to explore custom options, or discuss measurements and finishes. Please note that custom measurements and requirements will usually cost more.
INSTALLATION
Where possible try to install the item on a solid masonry wall. For this we recommend to use 2”8’s screws and red plugs using a 5.5mm drill bit to make the fixing holes. For Stud walls (Plasterboard), we recommend you use either an appropriate plasterboard fixing, fix into existing studs/timber batons or install a suitable sheet of plywood within the wall.
ADVICE
The appearance of copper, brass and timber finishes may differ from the images attached. However it will be made using the exact same materials and we will make your order as close to the images as possible. Dimensions stated are approximate and suitable tolerances/clearance space around this unit should be considered. We test each initial design we make. However we cannot guarantee what the strength of the piece will be. We advise that the item is not placed under heavy loads and not subject to high forms of stress.
DELIVERY
Items are made to order and dispatched within 1-2 weeks. Tracking IDs will be emailed to you at the point of dispatch to allow you to track your order through to delivery.

What You Need To Know?
You are sure to find a fiberglass bar table elsewhere on the market but don't be fooled by the look! Our tables have subtle yet clever details that really add to their quality and value, meaning our tables are stronger and better performing.
Chip & Scratch resistant finish
Glossy white solid fiberglass top is coated with transparent polyester sealant to prevent chipping & scratching.
Perfect combination of function and form
A velvet floor protection pad is attached to the bottom of the base to prevent the floor from scratching.
THE FINER DETAILS
PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
Inspired by the original design the tulip bar table is one of the most popular, and certainly one of the most beautiful pieces in our mid-century collection. The table features a round solid fiberglass top and a lacquered metal base. Its compact size has space for up to 3 to 4 stools.
Construction:
The solid fiberglass top is 1.5"" thick and heavy, giving balance to the unique table base. True to the original design the metal base is a perfect combination of function and form. Both fiberglass top and metal base are coated
with a scratch and chip-resistant finish. A velvet floor protection pad is attached to the bottom of the base to prevent the floor from scratching.

Why Buy From Modholic?
Do you have a store or a showroom that I can visit?
Even though we are locally situated in the heart of NY, Modholic is primarily an online-only retailer with no physical storefront or showroom location; it's a big part of who we are and what we're about! By operating locally and without an expensive retail space, we're able to offer some of the best pricing on high quality products.

If you have specific questions about any product, or need more information of any kind, please do not hesitate to contact us via chat, email or phone. We provide free material swatches upon request.
Do you charge sales tax?
We do not charge sales tax in any state except New York & New Jersey.
Can I place my order on hold/can you deliver after a certain date?
As long as your order hasn’t already shipped, we can put a hold on your order until you’re ready for us to send it! Just leave us a message in the order notes section that you need us to hold it and we’ll honor the request.
Do you offer discounts for business customers?
Modholic offers the option to register for a trade account and gain access to our exclusive business pricing. Please contact our sales team at sales@modholic.com
Do you price match with other retail websites?
Unfortunately, we do not price match with other retail websites. Various online retailers purchase Modholic Furniture brand items and sell them directly, much in the same way they’d purchase a particular brand of shoe factory-direct and resell them to customers. This allows retailers to apply their own pricing rules to our products, such as applying different shipping methods, whereas we never charge for shipping.
I have a question that is not answered here, can you help?
Our awesome customer service staff will be glad to help you with any other questions! Just drop us a line via the chat widget on the site, send us an email at sales@modholic.com, or give us a call at 929-800-5535

Product Care
Inlay Handmade Pieces
As with all things made by hand, these pieces are all unique and small flaws may be present, which adds to the intrinsic character and beauty of each piece.
Care Instructions
​To clean your bone inlay or mother of pearl inlay furniture, please wipe with a slightly damp cloth. After some time of owning your inlay piece, if the shine comes off slightly then please apply a small amount of coconut oil and white wax and clean it with a dry cloth.
Bone and mother of pearl inlay furniture has a porous surface, so items in high-use situations - such as coffee tables - should be sealed prior to use. Grout or polyurethane sealant (available from any hardware store) is suitable for this - example:
https://www.bunnings.com.au/cabot-s-500ml-satin-water-based-cabothane-clear-polyurethane-varnish_p1522368
Whilst this sealant is clear, when you are sealing your piece, we recommend using a very soft cloth in a circular motion (rather than a paint brush) in order to avoid any potential brush strokes left on your piece.
Please do not use regular cleaning products (surface cleaners, glass cleaners) to care for bone inlay. They are very harsh to use on inlay pieces.
If your piece is under direct and constant sunlight, the bone pieces may have the potential to turn a slightly yellow tone over time, and little exposure to sunlight can be useful to help them stay light for a longer duration. Please be careful that you don't put your inlay piece under extreme heat or directly under the sun.
If your inlay products may be used often (tray, drawers for example), the bone pieces may fall from edges during the use. The wood and bone both are naturally contracting and expanding materials but not at the same pace, so during season/weather change this could happen. Please use all-fix or super glue available locally to easily fix yourself if this may happen.
For our vase products, we would recommend covering your vase base prior to using, as these vases are not 100% waterproof.
Here is what our customers say
Thank you so so so much Becky and Lani for my beautiful new pieces of furniture. They are better than I had imagined them to be. I’m over the moon with them. You were wonderful to work with. Highly recommended.
Megan B.
I’m so in love with my mother of pearl chest of drawers! They are absolutely beautiful! Every part of the purchase and delivery process was smooth trouble-free! Thanks girls.
Lyn K.
Amazing customer service, it was such a pleasure to deal with Mahlia Interiors. Our coffee table was delivered with professional care taken, and the description online is exactly how our table arrived. I highly recommend Mahlia for your next purchase
Jane K.
We ordered two Bone Inlay Provincial Bedside Tables in Floral - Grey online during lockdown in 2021. Although we had to wait a long time to receive them, we were very impressed by Mahlia's communication and service. We just love these bedsides. They are the perfect fit for an old (and very high) brass bed. Highly recommended.
R. & J.
Thank you Lana for helping me choose the right piece for my bedroom and I absolutely love it! The mother of pearl floral chest is exquisite and the workmanship perfect. There were a few weeks delay due to covid, but Lana kept me informed on tracking along the way. Would most definitely use Mahlia Interiors again and thoroughly recommend the service and quality of the product. I shall be back
Surrey W.
It arrived so quickly and was packaged securely. I followed the care advice and coated mine in clear polyurethane to seal it, as I'll be using it to display some of my indoor plants. It looks beautiful when the light is on it.
Liz V.
I ordered the tissue box and matching tray as a ""Covid pick me up"". I cannot rave enough about the quality and aesthetic appeal of these Bone Inlay homewares. I highly recommend these products and plan another purchase soon.
Inger J.
Thanks for the great service & quick delivery. Coasters were packed really well. Love how they look with my tray. Thanks again, will definately buy again.
Rod K.
Beautiful chest of drawers delivered in just two days at Christmas time! The delivery men were helpful and on time. Updates from Mahlia were timely and friendly, I would be very happy to buy from them again.
Sue I.
I was a bit nervous ordering my mother of pearl chest of drawers ONLINE but with Mahlia it worked out beautifully! There was a bit of a delay in delivery due to COVID but the ladies from Mahlia were very responsive and kept me informed while we waited. The delivery itself was very easy and I now have a dream piece that I have always wanted! Thank you Bec and Lana
Gaye W.
The most gorgeous bone inlay trinket box. This was posted to me quickly and was packaged incredibly well. Would recommend for sure.
Morgan G.
I ordered the black floral rectangular try and now have another beautiful inlay piece for my home. It arrived really quickly and was packaged very well. Great service and quality. Love it!
Anne S.
I have a very beautiful chest of drawers of grey inlay. Quietly elegant. The company have been extraordinarily good keeping me informed about shipment delays, wharf strike concerns & all they had to deal with Covid. I highly recommend the company & all their products. Brilliant.

Furniture Care
The wood in our line of furniture lives and breathes with the seasons, often displaying slight movement due to changes in temperature and humidity. For full information and tips on this visit
HERE
.
Stained wood can be easily maintained with Furniture Wax, which enhances the natural beauty of the wood and nourishes and protects the piece.
Dust wood with a soft, dry cloth.
Do not use harsh care products that contain ammonia or silicone as this will cut through the finish over time and damage your piece.
Use coasters, trivets and felt pads under objects to protect the finish of your piece.
Never place hot dishes on surfaces - the use of felt-backed table mats is recommended.
Spills should be removed immediately with a cloth.
Always avoid exposure to direct sunlight or heat as this can cause cracking and potential fading; a minimum of 12 inches clearance from heat sources is advised.
Do not drag piece across the floor as this will cause damage or weaken joints.
Dropping furniture onto corners or feet will cause damage.
Toys, buckles and heels will scratch furnishings—prevent these items from touching your piece when possible.

What is Lorem Ipsum?

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

Finishes your living space beautifully without overpowering
Ideal pile density to withstand foot traffic & easy to clean
Care Instructions
Regular care is essential to the longevity of your rug. Regular vacuuming is recommended without the use of beater bars to avoid threads being pulled. Spills should be absorbed with a dry cloth, then spot cleaned with mild soap and water. It’s normal for loose ends to show up from time to time with any area rug, however it’s important to snip them with a scissor immediately - pulling on loose ends by hand is harmful to the strength of your rug. Rug tolerances can vary by +/- 3 inches in relation to the advertised size. A non-skid pad is recommended to prevent slippage. Since rugs are rolled for shipping, occasionally they may crease during transit. All creases will disappear within 2 weeks after the rug is laid out flat. Reverse rolling will help flatten out creases promptly.

WILHELM RENZ METAMORPHIC COFFEE TABLE
Fantastic mid century design from quality German manufacturer. Unknown designer but many famous designers have been employed by Wilhelm Renz over the years. Features two small extensible plates inside the normal tabletop which can be extended from either side. Teak or possibly maple construction. Rare item.
DIMENSIONS
Width: 140 cm
Depth: 50 cm
Height: 54 cm
I would be happy to provide any other measurements, just drop me a line.
CONDITION REPORT
Excellent vintage condition. There are a few minor marks and faint scratches to the top and legs consistent with age. The pull out sections run well. There is a small bit of damage to one corner of one leaf (pictured). There are some very faint ring marks to the green leaf but nothing too serious. There are no wobbles or loose joints. The metal ""WR"" badge is present. Overall the table has survived very well and is in great, usable condition. Ready for a new home.

Description
Dimensions
Availability
Hidden inside this cube ottoman is something very clever. Because the S-Cube easily transforms into 5 stools! The new design is even more compact and comfy.
Firstly, use the ottoman as a footrest or chair for your small space desk or even coffee/dining table. Secondly, when it's time for a get-together, remove the lid and slide out four additional stools. Subsequently, remove the sides of the cube ottoman and attach them easily to the stool tops - voila! Seating is cushioned, with a PU material, so it's easy to clean. Available in black or grey, so pick the colour that suits your decor.
KEY FEATURES
+ New design
+ Versatile seating (so it can be used from desk to dining)
+ Beautiful ottoman with PU cushioned seating when assembled
+ Ideal for home office, kitchen, kid's room, dining room, living room
+ Cube ottoman
Dimensions: 19.5""W x 19.5""D x 21.5""H

Its distinctive Y-shaped backrest is eye-catching and adds a touch of elegance to any space. Its elegant and minimalistic design makes it perfect for any setting, be it modern or traditional.
But don't let its good looks fool you - this chair is also provides incredibly comfortable support. The seat and backrest are both made from woven paper cord, which provides a soft yet supportive feel.

Bertha Chair
Inspiration

Inspiration
Solid. A dependable character of the highest sorts, the namesake of the Bertha chair is Bertha Wilson. The name came out of a conversation that the designer, Donna Wilson, had with Zita Cobb, founder of our parent charity, Shorefast. “When she found out that I was Scottish and my last name was Wilson, she shared a story about the only other Scottish woman whom she had ever met who went by the name of Wilson – Bertha Wilson. A woman of modest means, she became the first female appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada. It seemed like a fitting name for such a humble and modern chair.”
The Bertha Chair is inspired by the vintage barrel chairs that were constructed from unused flour barrels. These chairs embody the outport attitude of finding new life for discarded or unused materials. Pair the Bertha Chair with a Pouffe to kick back and enjoy the view.
Fabrication
Made using regionally sourced birch by our craftspeople at Fogo Island Workshops. Available in a range of finishes including hand-buffed Danish Oil, which deepens the amber colour of the wood, and White Oil, which neutralizes the amber tone for a raw matte look. Both absorb into the wood and richen the grain. A variety of coloured lacquers are available. Custom colours and sizing are available on request.
The cushions and matching pouffe can be upholstered in either Kvadrat Divina upholstery or the iconic Shingle-Shangle pattern, inspired by the hand-carved shingles on historic Brett House in Joe Batt’s Arm. Both are 100% wool that is ethically and sustainably sourced, naturally stain resistant, and comes with life-long durability rating of 45,000 Martindale rub tests.

Description
We love the beauty of natural oak, but does your space crave a little more drama? Meet the Linea! If your room is swimming in white oak, this collection is here to spice things up with bold oak strip panels and soft-closing doors that reveal a sleek black interior—because why should the outside have all the fun? On the flip side, are you looking for something more subtle? The Linea also comes in all-natural oak or all-black oak for those who prefer their drama with a side of calm. Either way, your space is about to get a whole lot more interesting!
Dimensions:
W159 D45 H76.1CM
The Timber
Wood displays different grain patterns depending on which way they are cut - for example, the 'medullary ray' which can appear on oak furniture is a mark of good quality timber, these are just characteristics of the natural beauty of the wood. Wood veneers also allow distinctive patterns to be created on some surfaces, such as table tops and drawer fronts by the way slivers are arranged. All timber and veneer surfaces will change colour and mellow over time. New furniture will initially vary in shade from items that have been previously purchased.
Freight Prices
Below is the typical freight price to large towns and Cities in NZ except rural.
All North Island including Auckland deliveries - $145
Wellington - free pick-up, (choose ""EMAIL bestfurniture@xtra.co.nz FOR A SHIPPING QUOTE"" at checkout).
Christchurch - $60 (or free pick-up)
South Island Cities or large towns - $75
This should come up at check-out, but if your address doesn't please email us on team@bestfurniture.co.nz and we will get you a quote.

All products come with a one year warranty against any manufacturing defects and any other issues with the materials or components used. However the warranty does not cover damages due to normal wear and tear in the natural course of use or due to usage of the product beyond its intended use.
We believe that furniture you like and wish to use for a long time should not have to be replaced in a hurry. With that in mind, we have gone to great lengths to ensure that all our products are designed and constructed to last! By following these simple care instructions, you too can do your bit to enjoy your furniture for years to come. For any other queries or information, feel free to contact us.
General Care
Wipe the surface with a dry or damp soft, clean, lint–free cloth or sponge in everyday cleaning; you can also use a mild environmentally friendly detergent
Always dry your furniture afterwards using a clean cotton cloth
Do not use abrasive detergents or abrasive sponges and cloths
Always protect your furniture from hot objects, liquids and dirt
Clean up spills immediately with a dry cloth
Avoid dragging sharp or rough objects across the surface of your furniture to prevent scratches
From time to time it may be necessary to tighten fittings; this is normal with all furniture and regular inspections should be carried out
Laminate
Wipe the surface with a dry or damp soft, clean, lint–free cloth or sponge in everyday cleaning
In case of textured laminates you can use a soft scrub brush to prevent build-up of dust
Remove ink, wine, wax crayons and similar stains using acetone or methylated spirits; wipe the surface with water and a mild environmentally friendly detergent; finish off by wiping the surface dry
Veneer
Wipe the surface with a dry or damp soft, clean, lint–free cloth or sponge in everyday cleaning
It is important to wipe in the direction of the wood grain; wipe dry afterwards with a clean cotton cloth
To remove dirt and finger prints, use a mild environmentally friendly detergent; dilute the detergent, dampen a soft cloth with it and wipe in the direction of the wood grain; wipe dry with a clean cotton cloth
Avoid cleaning products that contain oils or are ammonia based
Moisture and heat can damage any wood finish so protect your furniture from direct sunlight or excessive temperatures; always leave an air gap between your furniture and a radiator or similar heat source
Always use placemats, coasters and trivets to protect the surface from dents, scratches, heat and moisture from hot or cold liquids
Avoid direct contact with candle wax as it may react with the veneer's finish and leave a stain
Solid Wood
Wipe the surface with a dry or damp soft, clean, lint–free cloth or sponge in everyday cleaning
It is important to wipe in the direction of the wood grain; wipe dry afterwards with a clean, dry cloth
To remove dirt and finger prints, use a mild environmentally friendly detergent; dilute the detergent, dampen a soft cloth with it and wipe in the direction of the wood grain; wipe dry with a clean cotton cloth
Moisture and heat can damage or discolor any wood finish so protect your furniture from direct sunlight or excessive temperatures; always leave an air gap between your wood furniture and a radiator or similar heat source
Always use placemats, coasters and trivets to protect the surface from dents, scratches, heat and moisture from hot or cold liquids
If you choose to use protective covers, do not use vinyl or plastic material; they do not allow ventilation so  trap moisture and can give rise to mold and mildew
For long-lasting protection, it is advisable to wax your wood furniture once a year
Wood will expand and contract with seasonal humidity changes; maintain consistent humidity levels to minimize movement in the wood and prevent warping
Over time, air and sunlight will change the color of natural wood slightly; occasionally rotate the items placed on your wood furniture to allow a more uniform color to develop

F-CHAIR OUTDOOR
The F-Chair has been in close collaboration with Gascoin’s family from his original drawings, supported by intensive research and prototyping. The harmonious interlocking between the armrests, the rear legs, and the backrest took particularly high levels of craftsmanship to resolve.
MR01 INITIAL LOUNGE CHAIR OUTDOOR
Beautifully honest, light in both weight and expression. With its low-slung wooden frame and nautically evocative rope seat and backrest, Mathias Steen Rasmussen’s breakthrough MR01 Initial Lounge Chair has begged to be taken outside since its creation.
C-CHAIR OUTDOOR
The garden gets an upgrade with the simple functionality of French architect and designer 
Marcel Gascoin’s most enduring iconic design. Proportions have been fine-tuned to maximize comfort and the frame has been carefully crafted with traditional joinery using plantation teak.
BEETLE COLLECTION
Strikingly simple in form but full of personality, GamFratesi’s design combines crafted details and advanced manufacturing technologies to produce something truly original: a highly versatile, extremely comfortable, and beautifully expressive chair inspired by the forms of nature.

PACHA LOUNGE CHAIR
Iconic designer Pierre Paulin’s vision was to create a sensation of ‘sitting on clouds’. A little ahead of its time in 1975, the modular Pacha Collection is finally coming into its own as GUBI reissues this timeless and characterful collection.

SHIPPING POLICY
RETURNS & EXCHANGE
Our Returns Policy
We stand behind all of the products we have curated for our site, and we work with the best manufacturers in the world to ensure you'll love every Fine Line item in your home. The design details, quality, safety, and sustainability of our products will meet, if not exceed, your expectations. We hope you love your selections, but if you're not completely satisfied with your purchase, we'll gladly take returnable items in an unused condition fit for resale
within 7 days of delivery
.
(Note: Exclusions apply. See below).
Is My Item Returnable?
Not every item on our site is eligible for a return. Please note, we also do not accept returns on:
special order pieces
custom made to order items
used items or items without original packaging
altered items (repainted, refinished, cut, etc.)
final sale items or gift cards
international orders and orders outside of the contiguous US
How Do I Return My Item?
If you are returning an item, please keep your item’s original packaging and request a return immediately to receive a Return Authorization (RA) number. You may request a return by reaching out to our customer service team via email at info@fineline.us or by phone at 305-661-4414. If you have any questions about processing your return, do not hesitate to contact us.
NOTE: To request a return for an item delivered via our Premium White Glove Delivery, you MUST call our customer service team at 305-661-4414
Once you request your return, we will send you a return label with the appropriate return address and RA number within five business days of your return request. You will then have 14 days to return your item.
Note that all items shipped back without an RA number or outside the 14 day return period will not be accepted and will be returned to you. We cannot accept returns without the the original packaging.
Please note, products may only be returned from the location of original delivery.
How Can I Receive My Refund?
We offer two options regarding your refund for a return:
FINE LINE Store Credit:
Receive your return refund in the form of store credit for the merchandise price, less the cost of outbound and return shipping. If you return for store credit.
Original Form of Payment:
Receive your refund in the form of your original form of payment for the merchandise price, less the cost of outbound and return shipping AND up to a 20% restocking fee.
If we identify an unreasonable return pattern, we may restrict or refuse future transactions or returns from such customers at at any time.
Why Do You Assess Restocking Fees On Returns?
When you return an item, a lot of time, labor, and company cost is required to receive your package and restock your item back into our warehouses. Additionally, the majority of furniture and accessories returned are not packaged to original factory standards or incur damage during transit. Because we provide our customers free standard shipping many items and absorb that cost, we must assess restocking fees on returns to account for the quantity of returned items that cannot be accepted or resold.

Collodi Chair is a response to ever growing problem of plastic pollution and a proof that sustainability, when designed right, enhances rather than compromises on the ergonomic and aesthetic features of the product. Designed to bring a sense of lightness and good mood into a space, it does so by putting environmental needs first while also understanding comfort and emotions. Nested on a wooden frame, the shell is made entirely of industrial waste and is 100% recyclable.

Most furniture takes around 6-8 weeks to be ready to send. We will contact you when it's ready so that we can arrange a convenient delivery day.
Large items will be delivered using a courier service who can bring it in to a room of choice.  Very large, heavy items will be delivered by a 2-person courier team if this service is available to your postcode.
Courier delivery unfortunately isn't available to Northern Ireland, some remote postcodes in Wales, Scotland and England or any offshore addresses. For areas not covered by our courier we can package your order on a pallet and ship it with a parcel service. This will incur a surcharge starting at £40 for smaller furniture items. This will be automatically calculated at checkout for Northern Ireland. Please call or send us a message
here
if you want to discuss delivery options to your postcode.
Furniture items are delivered in separate easy to assemble sections with the legs detached. Usually assembly simply involves fitting the legs and connecting the upper and lower sections together with a few bolts (if your design has multiple wooden sections). We supply all bolts and tools needed and it only takes a few minutes.
We can also arrange assembly and removal of packaging using a white glove service that will do all the heavy lifting for you. This usually costs £35.
Please remember to provide a contact telephone number at checkout. All couriers require this and without it, we can't send your furniture!
International Shipping
The shipping cost depends on your country and the size of your order.
To see the shipping cost add a product to your cart and then use the shipping calculator at the bottom of the Cart page.
You can remove it from your Cart at any time.
Europe (EU)
:  we ship with duty and taxes payable by us, not by you, so you won't pay any more to import our furniture into your country. We will handle all the paperwork at our end so it's as easy and hassle free for you as possible. You just pay the shipping costs added at checkout.
USA
: there is no duty or tax to pay at the time of writing, just the shipping costs added at checkout.
In the event that customs tariff charges become applicable to imports then those are not included in our prices so will be payable by the customer at the point of import.
Europe (non-EU)
: you will need to pay import duty and taxes but the shipping cost will be free at checkout.
Canada/Australia/Others
: shipping will be added at checkout, or
contact us
to get a shipping quote, you will also have to pay any duties, fees or taxes which are applicable for customs imports into your country.
If shipping isn't showing as available to your location don't worry, we can still send it, but we'll need to do a custom quote. Just
message us
with the product/size you're looking for and we'll get back to you with a price.
Items will be sent with an international delivery company (usually UPS, TNT/Fedex or DHL). Unfortunately we can't arrange delivery on a specific day but we will send tracking details as soon as it has been dispatched. You will then be able to contact the delivery company to schedule/reschedule delivery. Delivery takes 3-10 days from the day of dispatch depending on your location and custom clearance times.
Delivery is to the street door, so ensure you have someone available to help if you are ordering a large, heavy item.
Any items not delivered by the courier's estimated delivery date must be notified to us within 14 days.
Furniture items are delivered in separate easy to assemble sections with the legs detached. Usually assembly simply involves fitting the legs and connecting the upper and lower sections together with a few bolts (if your design has multiple stacked wooden sections). We supply all bolts and tools needed and it only takes a few minutes.

Original Stag sideboard
Primed and painted in Farrow & Ball,
Down pipe.
All 5 handles are original brass which I have restored to give a black modern effect.
The main feature on this piece is a large Stag head drawer pull looking very proud to be there. Each drawer has been lined with a luxury geometric grey and copper design.
A wonderful solid piece that has been given a modern twist.
Dimensions:
Width-131cm
Height-71cm
Depth-46.5cm
REMEMBER:
Please remember that with all up cycled furniture, you will come across the odd chip, dink or imperfection due to being old. Any major repairs or obvious dents are worked on before the final finish. Character is key as well as perfectly painted furniture.

Made in britain
We feel its important to be part of the Made In Britain membership. Britain was and is a world leader in innovation and manufacturing. For that reason being ‘made in Britain’ is something to be proud. It is also extremely important for the environment that we focus on buying and using products that haven’t had to travel around the world in a container, when we could have bought something handmade from this country of far better quality that will be an asset to future generations.
Caring for the environment
We believe our approach to the environment is as simple as it can possibly be. You may have noticed that keeping things simple is something of a passion of ours. Life doesn’t and shouldn’t be complicated. Click the link to learn more about our eco policy.

AUTHORITY TO LEAVE
Did you know that our customers who authorise couriers to leave parcels in a safe place, known as an “Authority to Leave” (ATL), receive their goods faster and have higher levels of customer satisfaction?
If you can’t be home to receive your delivery, we encourage you to authorise couriers to leave parcels in a safe place out of the weather.
To do so - please tick the box above for ATL and you can provide these delivery instructions in the box provided.
This will allow you to receive your goods first-time and avoid the hassle of missed deliveries and re-deliveries and their re-delivery fees.
If you prefer not to allow us to leave your delivery in a safe place, we will require authorisation on delivery.
Under social distancing for contactless deliveries, our drivers will ask for your name and sign on your behalf.

Yes we do custom orders. As a matter of fact, more than half of our business consists of such. Wood products such as dining rooms, bedroom and dinettes can be ordered in numerous stains and finishes. Our upholstery can also be ordered in a variety of fabrics as well as leathers, to best suit your needs.
